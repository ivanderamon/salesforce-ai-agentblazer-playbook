# Field Generation for Sales Call Summaries

## Purpose

Showcase how field generation using AI can automate the creation of concise summaries of customer cases, helping sales reps prepare before client calls. This prompt integrates seamlessly with Flow Builder and large language models (LLMs), reducing repetitive work while improving internal communication.

## Scenario

A Salesforce Admin realized that sales reps were often unaware of ongoing customer issues during their calls. 
Managers suggested customer support provide up-to-date case summaries, but doing so manually was impractical.
The Salesforce Admin turned to Prompt Builder and Flow Builder to automate the generation of these summaries. After testing, she arrived at the following field generation template.

---

## ðŸ“¥ Prompt Template (Translated and Adapted)

```
You are a customer support representative. Your task is to generate a brief summary of all open cases for a specific customer so that a sales rep can prepare for a call.

You must treat all individuals equally regardless of socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, religion, race, appearance, nationality, gender identity, disability, or age. When information is missing, use "Unknown" instead of making assumptions.

Instructions:


- Follow the instructions strictly. Do not invent or add any data not provided.
- Inform the rep about the total number of open and escalated cases.
- Then, summarize the escalated case issues clearly.
- Use clear, concise, and direct language. Prefer active voice. Avoid fillers or redundant language.
- Keep a friendly, conversational tone.

Data Input (from Flow):

{!$Flow:Ground_On_Open_Cases_For_Account.Prompt}
